<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>After the murder of his father, a young lion prince flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery</p>
<h3>The Sea Beast</h3>
<p>In an era when terrifying beasts roamed the seas, monster hunters were celebrated heroes -- and none were more beloved than the great Jacob Holland. But when young Maisie Brumble stows away on his fabled ship, he's saddled with an unexpected ally. Together they embark on an epic journey into uncharted waters and make history. From Academy Award winning filmmaker Chris Williams (Moana, Big Hero Six, Bolt), The Sea Beast takes us to where the map ends, and the true adventure begins.</p>
<h3>The Lost Daughter</h3>
<p>Alone on a seaside vacation, Leda becomes consumed with a young mother and daughter as she watches them on the beach. Unnerved by their compelling relationship, (and their raucous and menacing extended family), Leda is overwhelmed by her own memories of the terror, confusion and intensity of early motherhood. An impulsive act shocks Leda into the strange and ominous world of her own mind, where she is forced to face the unconventional choices she made as a young mother and their consequences.</p>
